#Significant contribution of Components.

	To evaluate most important feature that explains the major part of variance of the
response. Computing dominant product helps to build high performing models

Libraries: Caret.

Steps involved:

	Evaluate how close the data are to the fitted regression line by coefficient of determination with different possible combinations of attributes.

	Rank the outputs in descending order.

	Determine the most contribute attribute which is affecting more based on low R squared values.
